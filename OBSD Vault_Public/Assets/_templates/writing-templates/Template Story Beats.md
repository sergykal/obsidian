ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE
Story beats are a list of milestones, key moments, and turning points that provide a bare-bones structure for your story to follow. They can be detailed scene descriptions, or a simple list of bullet points. When you write, the beats give you a direction and goal to aim for.

_These beats are based on Blake Snyder’s “Save the Cat” screenwriting method._

**1 — Opening Image**
_A visual or scene that sets the tone of the story and introduces the protagonist._

**2 — The Theme Stated**
_A scene that sets up or teases the message or essential truth of your story._

**3 — Set-Up**
_Scenes that introduce the characters’ world, introduce supporting characters, and point to changes to come._

**4 — Catalyst / Inciting Incident**
_The surprise moment that turns the protagonist’s world upside down and kicks off the main plot._

**5 — Debate**
_Tension mounts and the protagonist ponders whether to undertake the journey. What is at stake?_

_In the aftermath of the Crisis, the hero hits rock bottom emotionally as everything falls apart._

**13 — Break into Act III**
_The B-Story \[7\] returns to provide fresh ideas or a new inspiration, derived from the Theme \[2\]._
