ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE
The three-act structure is a classic method of storytelling with clear beginning, middle, and ending phases. The second act is typically much longer than the others, and can be treated as two sections divided by a climactic midpoint.

_This template covers the basics, but feel free to add as many details as you wish._
